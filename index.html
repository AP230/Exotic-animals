<h1>My Exotic animals</h1>
<h2>Axolotl (Amphibian)</h2>
<p>As legend has it, the axolotl is the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, which disguised himself as a salamander to avoid being sacrificed</p>
<p>Axolotl gills appear as feathery appendages on the outside of their bodies</p>
<p>Remarkably, axolotls are only found in a single location on Earth</p>
<p>Axolotls vary in colour from brown to pink to green.</p>
